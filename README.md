# XTTS🐸 vs Bark🐶

## 🔬 A repo for comparing two TTS models and their clonability

This project showcases side-by-side comparisons of two state-of-the-art text-to-speech (TTS) models:

- **XTTS🐸** by Coqui
- **Bark🐶** by Suno

for voice cloning on bark i used:

- **seed-vc** by Plachtaa

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> This project was created using only a **MacBook Air with an M2 chip, without the use of any external GPUs**.
> All TTS models were run with their **default settings**, so there is **still room for optimization and improvement**.
> For voice cloning on bark, i used seed-vc with its **default** parameters.

## 📝 General Comparison

### Clonability

- XTTS🐸: Voice cloning performance is generally excellent, though occasional voice cracking issues were observed. Overall, the cloning results were impressive and largely consistent.

- Bark🐶: With seed-vc, Bark produced solid cloning results, with performance comparable to XTTS. The cloning quality was good and not significantly different from XTTS, though some minor variations were present.

### Hallucinations and Deviations

- XTTS🐸: While XTTS did exhibit some hallucinations, they were less frequent compared to Bark. Hallucinations primarily occurred with short sentences and were typically confined to the end of the output.

- Bark🐶: Bark, had an "umm" sound at the beginning of nearly every sentence. It also experienced more severe hallucinations with short sentences, and there was one notable deviation where the output completely differed from the intended sentence.

### Performance and Stability

- XTTS🐸: Excellent performance with very short rendering times. The model was stable and consistent throughout testing.

- Bark🐶 with seed-vc: Performance was significantly slower on CPU, with long rendering times. The output was less stable and occasionally inconsistent.

### Voice Quality

- XTTS🐸: Voice quality was consistently good, with occasional voice cracking. Despite that, the overall output was clear and natural-sounding.

- Bark🐶: Voice quality was decent, but the speech often included excessive and unnecessary emotional tone, which sometimes made it sound less natural or intentional.

### Overall Observations

- XTTS🐸 consistently delivered strong performance across all categories. It excelled in clonability, producing natural and accurate voices with minimal artifacts. While it occasionally exhibited voice cracking and mild hallucinations (mostly at the end of short prompts), its stability and fast rendering times made it highly reliable—even on a CPU-only setup.

- Bark🐶 with seed-vc showed good cloning results, coming close to XTTS in terms of voice similarity. However, it struggled with performance and consistency—render times were long, it was prone to hallucinations and deviations (especially on short prompts), and the recurring "umm" sound at the start of outputs impacted the listening experience. Its voice outputs also included unnecessary emotional inflections, making them sound overly dramatic or unnatural at times.

In summary, XTTS is more reliable and practical for CPU-based environments, while Bark, although promising, needs fine-tuning and better handling of short prompts to match XTTS’s stability and clarity.
